        // 'static' means that the method belongs to the class itself, not to any particular instance of the class.
        // 'void' indicates that the main method does not return any value.
        // 'main' is the name of the method, and it's the entry point for our program.
        // 'String[] args' is the parameter list. It allows us to pass command-line arguments to our program.

        System.out.println("Hello, World!");

        // 'System' is a built-in class in Java that provides access to system-related resources.
        // 'out' is a static member of the System class, representing the standard output stream.
        // 'println' is a method of the 'out' object, used to print a string to the console followed by a newline.

        // The program execution starts at the main method, and this line is the first to be executed.
